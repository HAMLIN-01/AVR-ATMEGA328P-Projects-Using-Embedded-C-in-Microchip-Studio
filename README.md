# AVR-ATMEGA328P-Projects-Using-Embedded-C-in-Microchip-Studio
This repository contains various AVR ATmega328P microcontroller projects, programmed in Embedded C using Microchip Studio and simulated in Proteus. Each project covers fundamental microcontroller interfacing and embedded system concepts.
# Projects Included
Blinking of Alternate LEDs – Alternates between two LEDs with a delay.
Button Interface – Reads a push button input to control an LED.
Calculator – Performs basic arithmetic operations using a keypad and displays the result on an LCD.
DC Motor Control – Controls the speed and direction of a DC motor.
Keypad Interface – Reads input from a 4x4 keypad for user interactions.
LCD Display – Displays text or numbers on a 16x2 LCD.
Servo Motor Control – Controls a servo motor’s position using PWM.
Seven-Segment Display – Displays numbers on a 7-segment display.
# Tools Used
Microcontroller: AVR ATmega328P,
Programming Language: Embedded C,
IDE: Microchip Studio,
